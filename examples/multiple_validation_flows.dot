    // Sometimes it's useful to have multiple potential validation paths. For example, we might have a bot account
    // that should also be allowed to acknowledge alerts. To do this, we can specify multiple paths into the acks pseudonode.

    // First, the regular human path, which must have an email and a comment.
    test_email -> test_comment [type="regex" field="creator" regex=".+@example.com"]; // First check the email
    test_comment -> acks [type="regex" field="comment" regex=".+"]; // Then check the comment.

    // And then a bot path where we don't need a comment, if the `from` is `RespectTables`:
    test_respect_tables -> acks [type="regex" field="creator" regex="RespectTables"];
